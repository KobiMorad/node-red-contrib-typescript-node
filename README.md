# Node-RED TypeScript Node

*Node-RED TypeScript Node* is a small library for writing Node-RED nodes using TypeScript.
It allows the use of classes by extending the main class `Node` and makes use of the TypeScript type definitions for Node-RED.

Examples are available in the `examples` directory. 

#### :warning: Warning :warning:
This library is still in its very initial stages. As such, tread with caution.
